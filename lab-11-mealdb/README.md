# (Optional) Lab 11 - MealDB

An optional lab for those with time to spare! At the start of their adventure ezGroceries identified two APIs:

* https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php
* https://www.themealdb.com/api.php

Due to various reasons the team concentrated implement the CocktailDB integration, but integration with MealDB remained in the back of their minds.

Now the Cocktail functionality is successful we can expand our application and also support meals in our shopping lists.

Basic requirements:

* Add a meal search API (similar to the cocktails one)  
* Add the ability to add meals to a shopping sist (similar to the cocktails one)
* Return all the distinct ingredients of a Shopping List, extracted from both added cocktails and meals.
