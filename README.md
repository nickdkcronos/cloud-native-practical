# Cloud Native Practical

Workshop that combines some cloud native theoretical and practical modules. Focused on a Spring Boot application.

## Prerequisites

Following tools should already be installed

* GitHub account
* Docker
* IntelliJ

## Business Case

Our fictional company, ezGroceries wants to provide all sorts of Mobile apps to help people during their grocery shopping.

People can look up cocktails and meals through these apps and add them to a shopping list. The shopping list keeps track of all the distinct ingredients of the cocktails and meals added to the shopping list. 

They want to aim at a minimum viable product and they have identified two APIs that they want to use during this first phase:

* https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php
* https://www.themealdb.com/api.php

They plan to combine these two APIs in one of their own. They have a brand new Cloud-Native platform, based on OpenShift that they want to leverage.

## GitHub
